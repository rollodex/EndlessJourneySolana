# EndlessJourney
## Inspiration
Inspired by AI and the endless potential of GPT-3, this text adventure will challenge you and surprise you with one of a kind collectibles!

## What it does
This is a Journaling choose your own adventure game designed to be simple, entertaining and use the classification capabilities of GPT-3 to teach emotional understanding. 

## How we built it
The server was written in Python, and the core logic is a combination of Javascript and Python. 
The NFT collectible achievement badges are stored on the Solana blockchain, and are semi-fungible.
If two players get the same achievement, it will become less unique, but they are all tradeable and collectible!

## Challenges we ran into
Solana tokens have no name, I am researching integrating with metaplex but using a local registry for now

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Building an AI powered NFT project 
Learning new design skills
Practicing with the tools and commands in the Solana ecosystem. 

## What we learned
I learned a lot about the inner workings of GPT-3, the limitations of the technology and how to do sound prompt engineering
Also that Solana is very inexpensive and my new go-to smart contract platform!

## What's next for Endless Journey
